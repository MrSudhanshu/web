            <p>My project is a Snake game that features an awesome graphical user interface (GUI) developed using the

              length with each piece of food it collects, and the player must avoid running into the walls or the
              snake's own tail.
              The GUI of the game has been designed to be visually appealing and intuitive to use. It features colorful
              graphics, easy-to-use controls, and a high-score system that allows players to track their progress.</p>
